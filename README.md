# outdoor_semantic_segmentation
Convolutional neural network to learn drivable surfaces and natural obstacles in outdoor effectively through semantic segmentation. Basically an introduction to deep learning (computer vision) applications to autonomous vehicles. The output is three images, the orginal unfiltered image, the ground-thruth image with the segmentation and the prediction from the neural network like shown below:
